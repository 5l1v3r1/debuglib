BUT with the "NO-C++" exception. 

that means you are not allowed to translate the code
into C++, but you can happily link against it from C++.

this measure was taken to preclude C++ trolls from
luring the maintainers into converting the code
into inferior C++. this happened in the past with
lots of C projects, for example MAME. the most recent
project destroyed in such a manner is GCC.

C++ trolls try to convince maintainers of C projects
that C++ is more modern, nicer to use and fitter for
large-scale codebases or better reusable.
none of these claims is true.

The only beneficiaries of such a change (besides the
C++ trolls which don't understand C at all, and prefer to
code in a wasteful and bloated OOP manner) are CPU and RAM
vendors:
since C++ compiles much slower, it gives you the feeling
that your system is too slow and you must update.
the wasteful OOP style and vtable overhead will lead
to higher memory usage.
